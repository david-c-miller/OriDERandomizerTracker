# To Do
+ Add option for changing the background color
	- More important might be to change the color of the background image in the tracker
+ Fix the drag and drop setting (and remove the Edit toggle if possible)
+ Add additional tracking options
	- Non Randomizer (All Skills, All Cells, REO, etc.)
	- Other Randomizer Runs (All Events, All Dungeons, Any%)
	- **Need to make additional backgrounds for these trackers and move points
	  and other details to functions**
	- Need Cell images
	- Need Event location image
+ Lower CPU usage
+ Fix shared Dictionary usage (and the results Exception)
+ Fix redraw problems with threading
+ Add most recent pickup to the tracker (especially good for tourney)
  - This might be hard to do with the new ability pickups
  - Current best options seems to just check for what has changed

  # Done
  + Add toggle for 'Always on top'
  + Allow the window to be resized
	- Need to figure out the best way to resize things
